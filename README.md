Backend services for Is it hot right now?

These services have recently migrated to AWS Lambda; all production services can be found in the [`/lambda`](lambda) folder (most other folders are in the process of being removed as we depreciate the old site).

Our front end website code is now located at [`isithot/iihrn-website`](https://github.com/isithot/iihrn-website).
